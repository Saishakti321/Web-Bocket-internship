   inside head tag. 
-> We need selectors to select/target the element which we need to change type.
 Ex:-

   .className{
    fint-size: 20px;
   }                
   #idName{
    background-color: red;
   }                      
   </style>

*External css

-> Writing css in a separate css file and then connecting it to the html document with the help of 
   link tag.
-> We use link tag inside the head tag to connect the external css.

* Selectors in css

-> Css selectors are used to select the html elements that we want to change style.
-> There are 6 types of selectors are there in css.
1. Universal selector = it is used to select all the elements in the html document.
                     -> Denoted by '*'.
  Ex- *{
    font-size:10px;
    background-color:blue;
  }

2. Id selector = it selects the html elements based on the given id name.
               -> Id name can be provided by using "id" attribute
               -> Id name should be unique in an html documnent
               -> To select the id names in css use use "#" which acts as id selector.
               ex- #idName{
                background-color: violet;
               }

                  -> Class name can be provided by using cl;ass attribute, class name can be duplicate.
                  -> To select the class name in css we use "." that acts as class selector.
                     Ex= .className{
                       font-size: 20px;
                     }
